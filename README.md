We make an ant farm, with tunnels and rooms; we place the ants on one side; and we look
at how they find the exit.

How do we build an ant farm? We need tubes and rooms. We join the rooms to one another with as many tubes as we need. A tube joins two rooms to each other. No more than that. A room can be linked to an infinite number of rooms and by as many tubes as necessary. Then we must bury the ant farm. 

The goal of this project is to create a “Hex” simulator.
